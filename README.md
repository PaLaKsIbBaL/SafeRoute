SafeRoute – Smart Route & Safety Analysis Web App

📌 Overview

SafeRoute is a web-based application that helps users find optimal routes between two locations while also considering safety-related parameters. The project integrates interactive maps, routing APIs, and basic analytical logic to display routes, distance, and other outputs in a user-friendly manner.

This project was developed as part of an academic/learning initiative and demonstrates practical use of APIs, frontend development, and problem-solving skills.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* HTML5 – Structure of the web app
* CSS3 – Styling and layout
* JavaScript (ES6) – Core logic and API handling
* Leaflet.js – Interactive maps
* OpenRouteService API – Routing and directions

 Features

* Interactive map rendering
* Dynamic route plotting between two points
* Distance and route output display
* Error handling for invalid or unavailable routes
* Clean and simple UI for easy use



 How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository or download the ZIP file
2. Open the project folder
3. Open `index.html` in a browser (recommended: Chrome)
4. Enter/select source and destination
5. View the route and output on the map

 Note: An active internet connection is required for map and API loading.



  API Configuration

This project uses **OpenRouteService** for routing.

To run locally:

1. Create a free account on OpenRouteService
2. Generate an API key
3. Add the API key in the JavaScript file:

```js
const ORS_API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE";
